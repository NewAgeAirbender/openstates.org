<section>
<p>
  As of February 2020 bill tracking &amp; subscriptions are in open beta.  This power user feature lets you easily track all legislation that has been introduced on a given topic as well as subscribe to updates on existing bills.
</p>
<p>Here's a quick guide on how to get the most out of this powerful new feature:</p>

<div class="subscriptions-howto">

<div>
  <h2 class="heading--small">Step 1) Create an Account</h2>
  <p>
    The first thing you need to do is <a href="/accounts/signup/">create an account</a> and verify your email.
  </p>
  <p> You can <a href="/accounts/signup/">create an account</a> using a username &amp; password, or any common social media provider (Twitter, Google, Facebook, GitHub).
  </p>
  <p><strong>Make sure to <a href="/accounts/profile/">verify your email address</a>, we can't send alerts until that's done.</strong></p>

<div>
  <h2 class="heading--small">Step 2) Search for Bills</h1>
  <p>
    We currently support two types of subscriptions: saved searches and individual bills.
  </p>
  <p>
    Saved searches allow you to be notified any time a new piece of legislation that matches
    your search criteria is introduced.
  </p>
  <p>To create a saved search navigate to your state's bills page (e.g. <a href="/nc/bills/">North Carolina Bills</a>)
    and enter a search query.  After you see your results you can click the "Add Subscription" button, which will 
    ensure you're updated any time new legislation is introduced matching your criteria.
  </p>

</div>

<div>
  <h2 class="heading--small">...or Track Existing Legislation</h1>
  <p>You may also find legislation that you wish to track changes to.  Let's say you're curious to see all updates to the <a href="/nc/bills/2019/SB315/">North Carolina Farm Act of 2019</a>.  You'd navigate to the bill, and click the "Follow Bill" button beneath the bill title at the top of the page.
  </p>
  <p>Once clicked, you'll receive emails any time the legislation is updated in any way.  This means if a new sponsor is added, action is taken, or text is changed- you'll be informed that a change took place.  Perfect for keeping tabs on the legislation you're most interested in.

</div>
<div>
  <h2 class="heading--small">Step 3) Get Email Alerts</h1>
  <p>
    Now you can sit back &amp; wait.  We'll send emails when changes occur.  Our system updates each state at least once every 24 hours, so you can be sure you're up to date.
